## About 
This is a personal project created by me(jscriptural) to strengthen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
I've learn't a lot while building this project.

QuizApp is a simple web-based quiz app, where you answer questions on any  subject of your choice from the list of supported categories.
You're provided with twenty randomly selected questions on the subject of your choice. Each question carries 5 marks.
The time limit is set to 10 minutes for each category;

Supported categories are:
* Biology
* Chemistry
* CSS
* English language
* General Knowledge
* HTML
* Javascript
* Mathematics
* Physics
* Python

QuizApp is constantly evolving: more categories will be added and the general outlook will be improved upon.

### Tools 
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Vanilla JS**
